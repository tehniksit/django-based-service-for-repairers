The django-based service for employees of repair's service with database.

This is my first web-app which written on python-django.
I have a little plan of development. And i am going to implement that as it possible.

It uses SqLite3.


There are the buttons on main pages- they dont work, because they have direct way of site.
Unfortunately, i need to make something for working themselves...
And if you want to see it working you need to rename those with direct way of yours server

        sort of: yourhost/landing/
                 yourhosr/login/
                 or 127.0.0.1:8001/login, or 127.0.0.1:8001/landing

Hopefully i make something as quick as it possible.

 If you have any ideas you are welcome for helping.
